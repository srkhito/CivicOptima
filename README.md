# CivicOptima-AI

CivicOptima is a participatory AI system that connects citizen feedback with real policy proposals.

We aim to:

- Classify and summarize free-form citizen feedback using AI
- Generate policy suggestions based on those opinions
- Visualize proposals and voting results in a public dashboard
- Submit selected policies to government or organizations

This repository contains prototype code for classification (BERT), summarization and generation (GPT), and an API using FastAPI.
